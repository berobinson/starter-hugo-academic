abstract = {Summary
This paper analyzes deforestation in areas of overlapping land tenure in the northern Ecuadorian Amazon. We use a random coefficients model to test for differences in forest cover across tenure forms over time. Tenure categories are significantly associated with changes in deforestation, even after controlling for multiple factors. Deforestation slows dramatically in the latter time period; and model results link parks with reduced deforestation. The same is true for lands where indigenous territories overlap with forest protection. Our results suggest that Ecuador’s conservation incentive program could refine its targeting by focusing on indigenous areas and communal lands outside of parks.}
