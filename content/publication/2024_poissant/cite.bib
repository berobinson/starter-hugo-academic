abstract = {Abstract Small-scale fisheries are vital to millions of rural people, but surprisingly little is known about the environmental and socio-economic factors that guide rural peoples' decisions to adopt a fishery-oriented livelihood. We analyzed data from a large-scale household survey of 3929 households in 235 rural communities in the Peruvian Amazon to develop multi-scalar quantitative models to explain engagement in fishing and the relationship between fishing livelihoods and poverty. Households harvested an average of 1000 kg of fish and sold 450 kg over the 12 months preceding interviews. The mean total annual income was 3119 USD per household and fishing contributed 27\% to total income. Access to extensive floodplain habitat, geographical isolation, and an available workforce were important drivers of fishing activity, while poor market connectivity and limited financial capital restricted households from increasing the scale of market-oriented fishing. Wealthier households generally harvested more fish, whereas reliance on fisheries was greatest among poorer households who harvested less fish. Fisheries management and conservation initiatives in developing regions must consider the distinct drivers of fishing specialization across the full wealth spectrum with particular attention to “high reliance-high harvest” households.},
