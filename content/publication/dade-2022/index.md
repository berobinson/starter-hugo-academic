abstract: "Property rights are fundamental institutions that set the rules for
  who is allowed to use, manage, and control natural resources. Though the
  literature on property rights over natural resources is well developed.
  However, our understanding of the ways by which property rights govern actorsâ€™
  ability to obtain ecosystem services provided by these natural resources
  remains under-explored. Using the Adirondack Park, USA, as a case study, we
  develop a framework that pairs property rights theory with spatial analysis to
  show who can obtain ecosystem services across this landscape. We look at
  rights over three ecosystem services: timber, drinking water and recreational
  fishing. We show that property rights combined with ecosystem service flow
  affect who can receive ecosystem services, and where, across the landscape.
  Our results demonstrate that property rights can play a pivotal role in who
  can obtain ecosystem services across landscapes. However, more work is
  required to model the supply and flow of ecosystems services, and to connect
  these to property rights to fully capture the interactions occurring between
  property rights and ecosystem services, and how they influence who can obtain
  these services. This paper contributes to the literature by showing how
  property rights influence who the potential beneficiaries of ecosystem
  services are under different property rights regimes."
