Trained as a marine biologist, I am especially interested in the study of coastal and marine systems. I enjoy applied research and bridging the social sciences with ecology. As a result, my master’s thesis revolves around modelling both the social and ecological implications of rising sea levels for coastal regions at the global scale. I am also involved in projects on ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation.
