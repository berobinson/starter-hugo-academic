title: Natural Climate Solutions + Co-benefits 
summary: "Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) are changes in land systems that primarily aim to mitigate climate change. NCS pathways include wide range of practices & actions (Griscom et al., 2017), but how these correlate with other things society cares about - like biodiversity conservation or human well-being - has not been systematically documented. To better direct policy and guide action on where and how to implement NCS, this project asks: How do NCS pathways impact aspects of human well-being, biodiversity, and the environment?"
