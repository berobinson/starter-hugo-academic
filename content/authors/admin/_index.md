**Robinson Ecosystems & Livelihoods Lab**

My group looks at how people meet their needs through use of ecosystems and natural resources, and the role this plays in development. Core questions that drive our research are:Â 

* How does society depend on the environment?
* What institutions do we create to mediate that relationship?

Our research methods draw from environmental and development economics, ecology, development geography, and geographic information sciences -- collectively we take a land system science approach to answer policy-relevant questions.
