# I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher co-appointed to the Department of Geography and Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health at McGill University, working on the [Pathways to Equitable Health Cities](https://equitablehealthycities.org) project. My ongoing research interests include using quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the intersection of economic inequality, development and the environment. This includes understanding 1) the economic, social and environmental drivers of income inequality, 2) the health and environmental consequences of inequality 3) spatial inequalities in quality of life across economic and ecological contexts, and 4) challenges in creating equitable and sustainable policy. Current research focuses on poverty, inequality, neighborhood change, urban development and sustainability in Ghana and Canada.
